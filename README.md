# FTIRbaselines
Processes FTIR spectra of natural organic matter by finding exact peak locations, baseline-correcting the peaks, and converting them to relative abundances.

This script finds the exact wavenumber locations of specific peaks in FTIR spectra of natural organic matter (such as plants and peat soils). It then baseline-corrects the peaks and converts them into relative abundances (relative to the integrated area of the whole spectrum). It does this for the following peaks (approx. wavenumbers in cm^-1):

carb (1030): carbohydrates
arom15 (1510): aromatics
arom16 (1630) : aromatics, or deprotonated COO-
acids (1720): protonated COOH
aliph28 (2850): aliphatics, lipids, and waxes
aliph29 (2920): aliphatics, lipids, and waxes
